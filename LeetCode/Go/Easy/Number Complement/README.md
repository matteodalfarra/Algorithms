# Problem: [Number Complement](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-complement/description/)

## Problem Description
The complement of an integer is the integer you get when you flip all the 0's to 1's and all the 1's to 0's in its binary representation. 
Given an integer `num`, the task is to return its complement.

### Example
**Input:**
```plaintext
num = 5
```
**Output:**
```plaintext
2
```
**Explanation:**
- The binary representation of `5` is `101`.
- The complement is `010`, which is the integer `2`.

**Input:**
```plaintext
num = 1
```
**Output:**
```plaintext
0
```
**Explanation:**
- The binary representation of `1` is `1`.
- The complement is `0`, which is the integer `0`.

### Constraints
- `1 <= num < 2^31`
