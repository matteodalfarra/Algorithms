# Problem: [Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/description/)

## Problem Description
Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, you need to return the indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`. You may assume that each input will have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice. You can return the answer in any order.

### Example
**Input:**
```plaintext
nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]
target = 9
```
**Output:**
```plaintext
[0, 1]
```
**Explanation:**
The sum of `nums[0]` (2) and `nums[1]` (7) is `9`, which is the target value. Thus, the output is `[0, 1]`.
