# Problem: [Single Number II](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number-ii/description/)

## Problem Description
Given an integer array `nums` where every element appears **three times** except for one, which appears exactly once. Find the single element and return it.
You must implement a solution with a **linear runtime complexity** and use only **constant extra space**.

## Examples
**Input:**
```
nums = [2,2,3,2]
```
**Output:**
```
3
```

**Input:**
```
nums = [0,1,0,1,0,1,99]
```
**Output:**
```
99
```

## Constraints
- `1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 10^4`
- `-2^31 <= nums[i] <= 2^31 - 1`
- Each element in `nums` appears exactly three times except for one element which appears once.

## Submission Detail
- Runtime: **440 ms**
