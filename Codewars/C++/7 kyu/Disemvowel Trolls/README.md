# Kata: [Disemvowel Trolls](https://www.codewars.com/kata/52fba66badcd10859f00097e/cpp)

## Description
Trolls are attacking your comment section! A common way to deal with this situation is to remove all the vowels from the trolls' comments, neutralizing the threat.
Your task is to write a function that takes a string and returns a new string with all vowels removed.

```cpp
std::string result = disemvowel("This website is for losers LOL!");
// result = "Ths wbst s fr lsrs LL!"
```

### Note
For this kata, the letter y is not considered a vowel.
