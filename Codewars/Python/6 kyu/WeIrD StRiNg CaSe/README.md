# Kata: [WeIrD StRiNg CaSe](https://www.codewars.com/kata/52b757663a95b11b3d00062d)

## Description
Write a function that accepts a string and returns the same string with all even indexed characters in each word uppercased, and all odd indexed characters in each word lowercased. The indexing starts at zero, so the zero-th index is even, and you need to start over for each word.

### Examples
For the input string `"String"`, the function should return:
```
"StRiNg"
```
For the input string `"Weird string case"`, the function should return:
```
"WeIrD StRiNg CaSe"
```

### Notes:
- Spaces in the string will only be present if there are multiple words.
- Words are separated by a single space.

### Input:
- A string consisting of alphabetical characters and spaces.

### Output:
- A string with even indexed characters in each word uppercased and odd indexed characters lowercased.
